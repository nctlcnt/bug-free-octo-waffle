Shooting in black and white mode, to make the contrast between light and dark more prominent. I love the way the shadows bring additional depth to each photo, highlighting moving lines of trees in key locations and giving the picture a sense of movement.

I also love the way black and white photography makes the color of objects pop. A simple red rose will look so much more vibrant in a black and white photograph than it would in color.

The woods provides a beautiful backdrop for my photo shoot. It's black and white, so the contrast between light and dark is more prominent.

This shoot was all about creating contrast between light and dark, so we took advantage of the beautiful lighting conditions in the woods. Shooting in black & white mode helped achieve this effect by adding drama to my model's personality as well as emphasizing her natural beauty.
