Cool, you have found it.

This page is made by pure JavaScript and a bit of love.

Or a bit of React components? And a bit of state control?

But this doesn't involve any third-party library. I got this idea from great internet.

And a summary of this idea is `position: absolute`, calculate and transform.

To be honest, it was mind blowing to my 'CSS will do the layout' brain.

Anyway, if you found any issue, please tell me.
