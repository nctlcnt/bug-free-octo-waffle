We were shooting in the woods and I wanted to show the contrast between light and dark. So I decided to shoot in black and white mode, which is a good way to make the contrast between light and dark more prominent.

I also wanted to show how there are many different colors in nature, but with a few colors that are dominant.

At first I wanted to show the contrast between light and dark. So I decided to shoot in black-and-white mode using only the camera's flash in order to bring out more detail in the picture. I also wanted to show how there are many different colors in nature, but with a few colors that are dominant.

The best part about shooting a black and white photo shoot is that you can make the contrast between light and dark more prominent. This makes your photos look more "dramatic", which is something you want when shooting a photo shoot.
